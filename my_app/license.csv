"@electron/get@1.12.2","https://github.com/electron/get","","# @electron/get  > Download Electron release artifacts  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/electron/get.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/electron/get)  ## Usage  ### Simple: Downloading an Electron Binary ZIP  ```typescript import { download } from '@electron/get';  // NB: Use this syntax within an async function, Node does not have support for //     top-level await as of Node 12. const zipFilePath = await download('4.0.4'); ```  ### Advanced: Downloading a macOS Electron Symbol File   ```typescript import { downloadArtifact } from '@electron/get';  // NB: Use this syntax within an async function, Node does not have support for //     top-level await as of Node 12. const zipFilePath = await downloadArtifact({   version: '4.0.4',   platform: 'darwin',   artifactName: 'electron',   artifactSuffix: 'symbols',   arch: 'x64', }); ```  ### Specifying a mirror  To specify another location to download Electron assets from, the following options are available:  * `mirrorOptions` Object   * `mirror` String (optional) - The base URL of the mirror to download from.   * `nightlyMirror` String (optional) - The Electron nightly-specific mirror URL.   * `customDir` String (optional) - The name of the directory to download from, often scoped by version number.   * `customFilename` String (optional) - The name of the asset to download.   * `resolveAssetURL` Function (optional) - A function allowing customization of the url used to download the asset.  Anatomy of a download URL, in terms of `mirrorOptions`:  ``` https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v4.0.4/electron-v4.0.4-linux-x64.zip |                                                     |       |                           | -------------------------------------------------------       -----------------------------                         |                                                   |               mirror / nightlyMirror                  |    |         customFilename                                                        ------                                                          ||                                                       customDir ```  Example:  ```typescript import { download } from '@electron/get';  const zipFilePath = await download('4.0.4', {   mirrorOptions: {     mirror: 'https://mirror.example.com/electron/',     customDir: 'custom',     customFilename: 'unofficial-electron-linux.zip'   } }); // Will download from https://mirror.example.com/electron/custom/unofficial-electron-linux.zip  const nightlyZipFilePath = await download('8.0.0-nightly.20190901', {   mirrorOptions: {     nightlyMirror: 'https://nightly.example.com/',     customDir: 'nightlies',     customFilename: 'nightly-linux.zip'   } }); // Will download from https://nightly.example.com/nightlies/nightly-linux.zip ```  `customDir` can have the placeholder `{{ version }}`, which will be replaced by the version specified (without the leading `v`). For example:  ```javascript const zipFilePath = await download('4.0.4', {   mirrorOptions: {     mirror: 'https://mirror.example.com/electron/',     customDir: 'version-{{ version }}',     platform: 'linux',     arch: 'x64'   } }); // Will download from https://mirror.example.com/electron/version-4.0.4/electron-v4.0.4-linux-x64.zip ```  #### Using environment variables for mirror options Mirror options can also be specified via the following environment variables: * `ELECTRON_CUSTOM_DIR` - Specifies the custom directory to download from. * `ELECTRON_CUSTOM_FILENAME` - Specifies the custom file name to download. * `ELECTRON_MIRROR` - Specifies the URL of the server to download from if the version is not a nightly version. * `ELECTRON_NIGHTLY_MIRROR` - Specifies the URL of the server to download from if the version is a nightly version.  ### Overriding the version downloaded  The version downloaded can be overriden by setting the `ELECTRON_CUSTOM_VERSION` environment variable. Setting this environment variable will override the version passed in to `download` or `downloadArtifact`.  ## How It Works  This module downloads Electron to a known place on your system and caches it so that future requests for that asset can be returned instantly.  The cache locations are:  * Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `~/.cache/electron/` * MacOS: `~/Library/Caches/electron/` * Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/electron/Cache` or `~/AppData/Local/electron/Cache/`  By default, the module uses [`got`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) as the downloader. As a result, you can use the same [options](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#options) via `downloadOptions`.  ### Progress Bar  By default, a progress bar is shown when downloading an artifact for more than 30 seconds. To disable, set the `ELECTRON_GET_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable to any non-empty value, or set `quiet` to `true` in `downloadOptions`. If you need to monitor progress yourself via the API, set `getProgressCallback` in `downloadOptions`, which has the same function signature as `got`'s [`downloadProgress` event callback](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#ondownloadprogress-progress).  ### Proxies  Downstream packages should utilize the `initializeProxy` function to add HTTP(S) proxy support. If the environment variable `ELECTRON_GET_USE_PROXY` is set, it is called automatically. A different proxy module is used, depending on the version of Node in use, and as such, there are slightly different ways to set the proxy environment variables. For Node 10 and above, [`global-agent`](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent#environment-variables) is used. Otherwise, [`global-tunnel-ng`](https://github.com/np-maintain/global-tunnel#auto-config) is used. Refer to the appropriate linked module to determine how to configure proxy support."

English | [简体中文](/packages/babel-plugin-jsx/README-zh_CN.md)  ## Installation  Install the plugin with:  ```bash npm install @vue/babel-plugin-jsx -D ```  Then add the plugin to .babelrc:  ```js {   'plugins': ['@vue/babel-plugin-jsx'] } ```  ## Usage  ### options  #### transformOn  Type: `boolean`  Default: `false`  transform `on: { click: xx }` to `onClick: xxx`  #### optimize  Type: `boolean`  Default: `false`  enable optimization or not. It's not recommended to enable it If you are not familiar with Vue 3.  #### isCustomElement  Type: `(tag: string) => boolean`  Default: `undefined`  configuring custom elements  ## Syntax  ### Content functional component  ```jsx const App = () => <div>Vue 3.0</div>; ```  with render  ```jsx const App = {   render() {     return <div>Vue 3.0</div>;   } }; ```  ```jsx import { withModifiers, defineComponent } from 'vue';  const App = defineComponent({   setup() {     const count = ref(0);      const inc = () => {       count.value++;     };      return () => (       <div onClick={withModifiers(inc, ['self'])}>         {count.value}       </div>     );   } }) ```  Fragment  ```jsx const App = () => (   <>     <span>I'm</span>     <span>Fragment</span>   </> ); ```  ### Attributes / Props  ```jsx const App = () => <input type='email' />; ```  with a dynamic binding:  ```jsx const placeholderText = 'email'; const App = () => (   <input     type='email'     placeholder={placeholderText}   /> ); ```  ### Directives  v-show  ```jsx const App = {   data() {     return { visible: true };   },   render() {     return <input v-show={this.visible} />;   }, }; ```  v-model  > Note: You should pass the second param as string for using `arg`.  ```jsx <input v-model={val} /> ```  ```jsx <input v-model={[val, ['trim']]} /> ```  ```jsx <A v-model={[val, 'foo', ['bar']]} /> ```  Will compile to:  ```js h(A, {   'foo': val,   'fooModifiers': {     'bar': true   },   'onUpdate:foo': $event => val = $event }) ```  custom directive  ```jsx const App = {   directives: { custom: customDirective },   setup() {     return () => (       <a         v-custom={[val, 'arg', ['a', 'b']]}       />     );   }, }; ```  ### Slot   ```jsx const App = {   setup() {     const slots = {       default: () => <div>A</div>,       foo: () => <span>B</span>     };     return () => <A v-slots={slots} />;   } }; ```  ### In TypeScript  `tsconfig.json`:  ```json {   'compilerOptions': {     'jsx': 'preserve'   } } ```  ## Who is using  <table>   <tbody>     <tr>       <td align='center'>         <a target='_blank' href='https://www.antdv.com/'>           <img             width='32'             src='https://qn.antdv.com/logo.png'           />           <br>           <strong>Ant Design Vue</strong>         </a>       </td>       <td align='center'>         <a target='_blank' href='https://youzan.github.io/vant/#/zh-CN/'>           <img             width='32'             style='vertical-align: -0.32em; margin-right: 8px;'             src='https://img.yzcdn.cn/vant/logo.png'           />           <br>           <strong>Vant</strong>         </a>       </td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>  ## Compatibility  This repo is only compatible with:  - **Babel 7+** - **Vue 3+**"
"@vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx@1.1.2","https://github.com/vuejs/jsx/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx","","## @vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx  > Babel plugin for Vue 2.0 JSX  ### Babel Compatibility Notes  - This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x, for 6.x please use [vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx)  ### Requirements  - Assumes you are using Babel with a module bundler e.g. Webpack, because the spread merge helper is imported as a module to avoid duplication.  - This is mutually exclusive with `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx`.  ### Usage  ```bash npm install @vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx --save-dev npm install @vue/babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props --save ```  In your `.babelrc`:  ```json {   'plugins': ['transform-vue-jsx'] } ```  However it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.  ### Details  The plugin transpiles the following JSX:  ```jsx <div id='foo'>{this.text}</div> ```  To the following JavaScript:  ```js h(   'div',   {     attrs: {       id: 'foo',     },   },   [this.text], ) ```  Note the `h` function, which is a shorthand for a Vue instance's `$createElement` method, must be in the scope where the JSX is. Since this method is passed to component render functions as the first argument, in most cases you'd do this:  ```js Vue.component('jsx-example', {   render(h) {     // <-- h must be in scope     return <div id='foo'>bar</div>   }, }) ```  ### Difference from React JSX  First, Vue 2.0's vnode format is different from React's. The second argument to the `createElement` call is a 'data object' that accepts nested objects. Each nested object will be then processed by corresponding modules:  ```js render (h) {   return h('div', {     // Component props     props: {       msg: 'hi'     },     // Normal HTML attributes     attrs: {       id: 'foo'     },     // DOM props     domProps: {       innerHTML: 'bar'     },     // Event handlers are nested under 'on', though     // modifiers such as in v-on:keyup.enter are not     // supported. You'll have to manually check the     // keyCode in the handler instead.     on: {       click: this.clickHandler     },     // For components only. Allows you to listen to     // native events, rather than events emitted from     // the component using vm.$emit.     nativeOn: {       click: this.nativeClickHandler     },     // Class is a special module, same API as `v-bind:class`     class: {       foo: true,       bar: false     },     // Style is also same as `v-bind:style`     style: {       color: 'red',       fontSize: '14px'     },     // Other special top-level properties     key: 'key',     ref: 'ref',     // Assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for     refInFor: true,     slot: 'slot'   }) } ```  The equivalent of the above in Vue 2.0 JSX is:  ```jsx render (h) {   return (     <div       // Component props       propsMsg='hi'       // Normal attributes or component props.       id='foo'       // DOM properties are prefixed with `domProps`       domPropsInnerHTML='bar'       // event listeners are prefixed with `on` or `nativeOn`       onClick={this.clickHandler}       nativeOnClick={this.nativeClickHandler}       // other special top-level properties       class={{ foo: true, bar: false }}       style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '14px' }}       key='key'       ref='ref'       // assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for       refInFor       slot='slot'>     </div>   ) } ```  ### Component Tip  If a custom element starts with lowercase, it will be treated as a string id and used to lookup a registered component. If it starts with uppercase, it will be treated as an identifier, which allows you to do:  ```js import Todo from './Todo.js'  export default {   render(h) {     return <Todo /> // no need to register Todo via components option   }, } ```  ### JSX Spread  JSX spread is supported, and this plugin will intelligently merge nested data properties. For example:  ```jsx const data = {   class: ['b', 'c'], } const vnode = <div class='a' {...data} /> ```  The merged data will be:  ```js { class: ['a', 'b', 'c'] } ```  ### Vue directives  Vue directives are usable the same way as in template with a few key differences:  1.  You can use directives camelCased instead of kebab-cased (vMyDirective is treated as `v-my-directive`) 2.  You have to use underscore sign instead of dots for modifiers because of JSXIdentifier limitation. 3.  Only runtime directives work (only v-show and custom directives), compile-time directives are out of this project's scope.  A full example would be: `<MyComponent vMyDirective:argument_modifier1_modifier2={someExpression} />`"

It is used in [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) version 15 and above.  The API surface is intentionally minimal - the goal is to reuse as much as possible while being as flexible as possible.  ## Why isn't `vue-template-compiler` a peerDependency?  Since this package is more often used as a low-level utility, it is usually a transitive dependency in an actual Vue project. It is therefore the responsibility of the higher-level package (e.g. `vue-loader`) to inject `vue-template-compiler` via options when calling the `parse` and `compileTemplate` methods.  Not listing it as a peer depedency also allows tooling authors to use a non-default template compiler instead of `vue-template-compiler` without having to include it just to fullfil the peer dep requirement.  ## API  ### parse(ParseOptions): SFCDescriptor  Parse raw single file component source into a descriptor with source maps. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.  ``` ts interface ParseOptions {   source: string   filename?: string   compiler: VueTemplateCompiler   // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilerparsecomponentfile-options   // default: { pad: 'line' }   compilerParseOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerParseOptions   sourceRoot?: string   needMap?: boolean }  interface SFCDescriptor {   template: SFCBlock | null   script: SFCBlock | null   styles: SFCBlock[]   customBlocks: SFCCustomBlock[] }  interface SFCCustomBlock {   type: string   content: string   attrs: { [key: string]: string | true }   start: number   end: number   map?: RawSourceMap }  interface SFCBlock extends SFCCustomBlock {   lang?: string   src?: string   scoped?: boolean   module?: string | boolean } ```  ### compileTemplate(TemplateCompileOptions): TemplateCompileResults  Takes raw template source and compile it into JavaScript code. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.  It can also optionally perform pre-processing for any templating engine supported by [consolidate](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js/).  ``` ts interface TemplateCompileOptions {   source: string   filename: string    compiler: VueTemplateCompiler   // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilercompiletemplate-options   // default: {}   compilerOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerOptions    // Template preprocessor   preprocessLang?: string   preprocessOptions?: any    // Transform asset urls found in the template into `require()` calls   // This is off by default. If set to true, the default value is   // {   //   audio: 'src',   //   video: ['src', 'poster'],   //   source: 'src',   //   img: 'src',   //   image: ['xlink:href', 'href'],   //   use: ['xlink:href', 'href']   // }   transformAssetUrls?: AssetURLOptions | boolean    // For vue-template-es2015-compiler, which is a fork of Buble   transpileOptions?: any    isProduction?: boolean  // default: false   isFunctional?: boolean  // default: false   optimizeSSR?: boolean   // default: false    // Whether prettify compiled render function or not (development only)   // default: true   prettify?: boolean }  interface TemplateCompileResult {   ast: Object | undefined   code: string   source: string   tips: string[]   errors: string[] }  interface AssetURLOptions {   [name: string]: string | string[] } ```  #### Handling the Output  The resulting JavaScript code will look like this:  ``` js var render = function (h) { /* ... */} var staticRenderFns = [function (h) { /* ... */}, function (h) { /* ... */}] ```  It **does NOT** assume any module system. It is your responsibility to handle the exports, if needed.  ### compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)  Take input raw CSS and applies scoped CSS transform. It does NOT handle pre-processors. If the component doesn't use scoped CSS then this step can be skipped.  ``` ts interface StyleCompileOptions {   source: string   filename: string   id: string   map?: any   scoped?: boolean   trim?: boolean   preprocessLang?: string   preprocessOptions?: any   postcssOptions?: any   postcssPlugins?: any[] }  interface StyleCompileResults {   code: string   map: any | void   rawResult: LazyResult | void // raw lazy result from PostCSS   errors: string[] } ```  ### compileStyleAsync(StyleCompileOptions)  Same as `compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)` but it returns a Promise resolving to `StyleCompileResults`. It can be used with async postcss plugins."

"@vue/web-component-wrapper@1.2.0","https://github.com/vuejs/web-component-wrapper","","# @vue/web-component-wrapper [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/vue-web-component-wrapper.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/vue-web-component-wrapper)  > Wrap and register a Vue component as a custom element.  ## Compatibility  **[Requires ES2015 classes](https://caniuse.com/es6-class). IE11 and below not supported.**  - **If targeting browsers that natively supports ES2015, but not native Web Components:**    You will also need the [Shady DOM + Custom Elements polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/blob/master/webcomponents-sd-ce.js).    See caniuse for support on [Custom Elements v1](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1) and [Shadow DOM v1](https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdomv1).  - **Note on CSS Encapsulation When Using the Shady DOM polyfill**    It's recommended to use [CSS Modules](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/css-modules.html) instead of `<style scoped>` in your `*.vue` files if you intend to use the Shady DOM polyfill, because it does not offer real style encapsulation like Shadow DOM does, so external stylesheets may affect your components if not using hashed class names.  - **If targeting browsers that does not support ES2015:**    You might want to reconsider since you'll be better off not using Web Components in this case.  ## Usage  - **`dist/vue-wc-wrapper.js`**: This file is in ES modules format. It's the default export for bundlers, and can be used in browsers with `<script type='module'>`.  - **`dist/vue-wc-wrapper.global.js`**: This is for old school `<script>` includes in browsers that do not support `<script type='module'>` yet (exposes `wrapVueWebComponent` global).  ``` js import Vue from 'vue' import wrap from '@vue/web-component-wrapper'  const Component = {   // any component options }  const CustomElement = wrap(Vue, Component)  window.customElements.define('my-element', CustomElement) ```  Note it works with async components as well - the async component factory will only be called when an instance of the custom element is created on the page:  ``` js const CustomElement = wrap(Vue, () => import(`MyComponent.vue`))  window.customElements.define('my-element', CustomElement) ```  ## Interface Proxying Details  ### Props  - All `props` declared in the Vue component are exposed on the custom element as its properties. Kebab-case props are converted to camelCase properties, similar to how they are converted in Vue.  - Setting properties on the custom element updates the props passed to the inner Vue component.  - Setting attributes on the custom element updates corresponding declared props. Attributes are mapped to kebab-case. For example, a prop named `someProp` will have a corresponding attribute named `some-prop`.  - Attributes that map to props declared with `type: Boolean` are auto-casted into boolean values in the following rules:    - `''` or same value as attribute name: -> `true`    - `'true'` -> `true`    - `'false'` -> `false`  - Attributes that map to props declared with `type: Number` are auto-casted into numbers if the value is a parsable number.  ### Events  Custom events emitted on the inner Vue component are dispatched on the custom element as a `CustomEvent`. Additional arguments passed to `$emit` will be exposed as an Array as `event.detail`.  ### Slots  Slots work the same way as expected, including named slots. They also update when changed (using `MutationObserver`).  Scoped slots however, are not supported as they are a Vue specific concept.  ### Lifecycle  When the custom element is removed from the document, the Vue component behaves just as if it's inside a `<keep-alive>` and its `deactivated` hook will be called. When it's inserted again, the `activated` hook will be called.  If you wish to destroy the inner component, you'd have to do that explicitly:  ``` js myElement.vueComponent.$destroy() ```  ## Acknowledgments  Special thanks to the prior work by @karol-f in [vue-custom-element](https://github.com/karol-f/vue-custom-element).  ## License  MIT"

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

"assert-plus@1.0.0","https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus","","# assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:  ```javascript     var assert = require('assert-plus');      function fooAccount(options, callback) {         assert.object(options, 'options');         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');         assert.func(callback, 'callback');          // Do stuff         callback(null, {});     } ```  # API  All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError` will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:      AssertionError: foo (string) is required     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)  from:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.string(foo, 'foo');     } ```  There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     } ```  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):  ```javascript     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo'); ```  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from the `assert` module avoids this behavior.  The complete list of APIs is:  * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError  # Installation      npm install assert-plus  ## License  The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"bn.js@4.11.9","https://github.com/indutny/bn.js","Copyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.","# <img src='./logo.png' alt='bn.js' width='160' height='160' />  > BigNum in pure javascript  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)  ## Install `npm install --save bn.js`  ## Usage  ```js const BN = require('bn.js');  var a = new BN('dead', 16); var b = new BN('101010', 2);  var res = a.add(b); console.log(res.toString(10));  // 57047 ```  **Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.  ## Notation  ### Prefixes  There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:  * `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on   which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs * `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or   always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations   like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be   added to the result to make it positive  ### Postfixes  The only available postfix at the moment is:  * `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript   Number. Decimals are not supported.  ### Examples  * `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a` * `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value * `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13  ## Instructions  Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).  ### Utilities  * `a.clone()` - clone number * `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes * `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits) * `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`) * `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero   pad to length, throwing if already exceeding * `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,   which must behave like an `Array` * `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For   compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:   `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)` * `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied * `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits   (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits) * `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied * `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative * `a.isEven()` - no comments * `a.isOdd()` - no comments * `a.isZero()` - no comments * `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)   depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`) * `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`) * `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`) * `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`) * `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`) * `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width * `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width * `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance  ### Arithmetics  * `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`) * `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`) * `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`) * `a.sqr()` - square (`i`) * `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b` * `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`) * `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`) * `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division  ### Bit operations  * `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced   with `andn` in future) * `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1` * `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`) * `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set * `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`) * `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number * `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)  ### Reduction  * `a.gcd(b)` - GCD * `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`) * `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`  ## Fast reduction  When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm for [Mersenne Prime][1].  ### Reduction context  To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:  ```js var red = BN.red(num); ``` where `num` is just a BN instance.  Or:  ```js var red = BN.red(primeName); ```  Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:  * `'k256'` * `'p224'` * `'p192'` * `'p25519'`  Or:  ```js var red = BN.mont(num); ```  To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than `.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.  ### Converting numbers  Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted to it. Usually, this means that one should:  * Convert inputs to reducted ones * Operate on them in reduction context * Convert outputs back from the reduction context  Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:  ```js var redA = a.toRed(red); ``` Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above  Here is how to convert them back:  ```js var a = redA.fromRed(); ```  ### Red instructions  Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their counterparts in red context:  * `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)` * `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)` * `a.redShl(num)` * `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)` * `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()` * `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime * `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number * `a.redNeg()` * `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation  ## LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

"boolbase@1.0.0","https://github.com/fb55/boolbase","","#boolbase This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).  ###WTF?  By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.  ###And why is this a separate module?  I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem."

"buffer-json@2.0.0","https://github.com/jprichardson/buffer-json","","# buffer-json  ``` npm install buffer-json ```  ```js const BJSON = require('buffer-json')  const str = BJSON.stringify({ buf: Buffer.from('hello') }) // => '{'buf':{'type':'Buffer','data':'base64:aGVsbG8='}}'  BJSON.parse(str) // => { buf: <Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f> } ```  The [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) class in Node.js is used to represent binary data. JSON does not specify a way to encode binary data, so the Node.js implementation of `JSON.stringify` represents buffers as an object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: [<bytes as numbers>] }`. Unfortunately, `JSON.parse` does not turn this structure back into a `Buffer` object:  ``` $ node > JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({ buf: Buffer.from('hello world') })) { buf:    { type: 'Buffer',      data: [ 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100 ] } } ```  `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` accept arguments called [`replacer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter) and [`reviver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter) respectively which allow customizing the parsing/encoding behavior. This module provides a replacer which encodes Buffer data as a base64-encoded string, and a reviver which turns JSON objects which contain buffer-like data (either as arrays of numbers or strings) into `Buffer` instances. All other types of values are parsed/encoded as normal.  ## API  ### `stringify(value[, space])`  Convenience wrapper for [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) with the `replacer` described below.  ### `parse(text)`  Convenience wrapper for [`JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) with the `reviver` described below.  ### `replacer(key, value)`  A [`replacer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter) implementation which turns every value that is a `Buffer` instance into an object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: 'base64:<base64-encoded buffer content>' }`. Empty buffers are encoded as `{ type: 'Buffer', data: '' }`.  ### `reviver(key, value)`  A [`reviver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter) implementation which turns every object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: <array of numbers or string> }` into a `Buffer` instance.  ## Related modules  - [`buffer-json-encoding`](https://github.com/lachenmayer/buffer-json-encoding): an [`abstract-encoding`](https://github.com/mafintosh/abstract-encoding) compatible JSON encoder/decoder which uses this module.  ## License  MIT"

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an 'as-is' basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.  Using Creative Commons Public Licenses  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.       Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are      intended for use by those authorized to give the public      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-      licensed material, or material used under an exception or      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: 	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors       Considerations for the public: By using one of our public      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of      the licensed material may still be restricted for other      reasons, including because others have copyright or other      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations      for the public:  	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees  =======================================================================  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ('Public License'). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.   Section 1 -- Definitions.    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is      synched in timed relation with a moving image.    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar      Rights.    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international      agreements.    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public      License.    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights      under this Public License.    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material      available to the public including in ways that members of the      public may access the material from a place and at a time      individually chosen by them.    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.   Section 2 -- Scope.    a. License grant.         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:              a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or                in part; and              b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with           its terms and conditions.         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section           6(a).         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)           (4) never produces Adapted Material.         5. Downstream recipients.              a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this                Public License.              b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed                Material.         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).    b. Other rights.         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed           Rights, but not otherwise.         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this           Public License.         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly           reserves any right to collect such royalties.   Section 3 -- License Conditions.  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.    a. Attribution.         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified           form), You must:              a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor                with the Licensed Material:                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed                     Material and any others designated to receive                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if                     designated);                  ii. a copyright notice;                 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of                     warranties;                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the                     extent reasonably practicable;              b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and              c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or                hyperlink to, this Public License.         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required           information.         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent           reasonably practicable.         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted           Material from complying with this Public License.   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial      portion of the contents of the database;    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE.

WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and      waiver of all liability.   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License      terminate automatically.    b.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations      of this Public License.    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so      will not terminate this Public License.    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public      License.   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.   Section 8 -- Interpretation.    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully      be made without permission under this Public License.    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and      conditions.    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the      Licensor.    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.   =======================================================================  Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)  ## Why? Node.js `fs.watch`:  * Doesn't report filenames on MacOS. * Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS. * Often reports events twice. * Emits most changes as `rename`. * Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues) * Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.  Node.js `fs.watchFile`:  * Almost as bad at event handling. * Also does not provide any recursive watching. * Results in high CPU utilization.  Chokidar resolves these problems.  Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/), [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io), [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2), [browserify](http://browserify.org/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/), [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/). It has proven itself in production environments.  ## How? Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using `fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.  On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin `FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.  On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much more than needed.  ## Getting started Install with npm:  ```sh npm install chokidar ```  Then `require` and use it in your code:  ```javascript var chokidar = require('chokidar');  // One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {   console.log(event, path); }); ```  ```javascript // Example of a more typical implementation structure:  // Initialize watcher. var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {   ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,   persistent: true });  // Something to use when events are received. var log = console.log.bind(console); // Add event listeners. watcher   .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))   .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))   .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));  // More possible events. watcher   .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))   .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))   .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))   .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))   .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {     log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);   });  // 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second // argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {   if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`); });  // Watch new files. watcher.add('new-file'); watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);  // Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();  // Un-watch some files. watcher.unwatch('new-file*');  // Stop watching. watcher.close();  // Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example) chokidar.watch('file', {   persistent: true,    ignored: '*.txt',   ignoreInitial: false,   followSymlinks: true,   cwd: '.',   disableGlobbing: false,    usePolling: true,   interval: 100,   binaryInterval: 300,   alwaysStat: false,   depth: 99,   awaitWriteFinish: {     stabilityThreshold: 2000,     pollInterval: 100   },    ignorePermissionErrors: false,   atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100) });  ```  ## API  `chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`  * `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched recursively, or glob patterns. * `options` (object) Options object as defined below:  #### Persistence  * `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to `false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.  #### Path filtering  * `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition) Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second time with two arguments (the path and the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object of that path). * `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event). * `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following the link references and bubbling events through the link's path. * `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this. * `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as literal path names, even if they look like globs.  #### Performance  * `usePolling` (default: `false`). Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the `useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option. * _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)   * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also     set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.   * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system   polling for binary files.   ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json)) * `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the `fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default. * `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't already available from the underlying watch events. * `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of subdirectories will be traversed. * `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`). By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change` events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases, especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification. Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size, holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive. Use with caution.   * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust   timing params:*   * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in   milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.   * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.  #### Errors * `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM` or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently. * `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`). Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use 'atomic writes' instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in milliseconds.  ### Methods & Events  `chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:  * `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event. Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`, `raw`, `error`. Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`. * `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns. Takes an array of strings or just one string. * `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files. * `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.  ## CLI  If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.  ## Install Troubleshooting  * `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`   * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is     not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,     Chokidar should function properly.  * `ERR! stack Error: Python executable 'python' is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`   * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:     `npm config set python python2.7`  * `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`   * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools  ## License  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"chromium-pickle-js@0.2.0","https://github.com/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js","","# chromium-pickle-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js)  This module ports Chromium's `Pickle` class to Node, see `Pickle`'s header for introduction:  > This class provides facilities for basic binary value packing and unpacking. > > The Pickle class supports appending primitive values (ints, strings, etc.) > to a pickle instance.  The Pickle instance grows its internal memory buffer > dynamically to hold the sequence of primitive values.   The internal memory > buffer is exposed as the 'data' of the Pickle.  This 'data' can be passed > to a Pickle object to initialize it for reading. > > When reading from a Pickle object, it is important for the consumer to know > what value types to read and in what order to read them as the Pickle does > not keep track of the type of data written to it. > > The Pickle's data has a header which contains the size of the Pickle's > payload.  It can optionally support additional space in the header.  That > space is controlled by the header_size parameter passed to the Pickle > constructor.  ## Install  ```bash $ npm install chromium-pickle-js ```  ## Usage  ### createEmpty()  Returns an empty `Pickle` object.  ### createFromBuffer(buffer)  * `buffer` Buffer  Returns a `Pickle` object that initialized from a `buffer`. The data is not copied so you have to ensure the `buffer` lives when using the Pickle object, and you should never modify the Pickle object created this way.  ### Pickle.createIterator()  Returns a `PickleIterator` object that can be used to read data from this `Pickle` object.  ### Pickle.toBuffer()  Returns a `Buffer` object that contains this `Pickle` object's data.  ### Pickle.writeBool(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `bool`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeInt(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `int`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeUInt32(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `uint32`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeInt64(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `int64`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeUInt64(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `uint64`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeFloat(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `float`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeDouble(value)  Writes `value` to `Pickle` object as `Double`. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### Pickle.writeString(str)  * `str` String  Writes `str` to `Pickle` object. Returns `true` when succeeded and returns `false` when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readBool()  Returns current value as `bool` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readInt()  Returns current value as `int` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readUInt32()  Returns current value as `uint32` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readInt64()  Returns current value as `int64` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readUInt64()  Returns current value as `uint64` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readFloat()  Returns current value as `float` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readDouble()  Returns current value as `double` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed.  ### PickleIterator.readString()  Returns current value as `String` and seeks to next data. A`TypeError` exception would be thrown when failed."

"consola@2.15.0","https://github.com/nuxt/consola","","<p align='center'>   <h1>🐨 Consola</h1>   <span>Elegant Console Logger for Node.js and Browser</span> </p>  [![Standard JS][standard-js-src]][standard-js-href] [![npm version][npm-version-src]][npm-version-href] [![npm downloads][npm-downloads-src]][npm-downloads-href] [![package phobia][package-phobia-src]][package-phobia-href] [![bundle phobia][bundle-phobia-src]][bundle-phobia-href]  ## Why Consola?  - Easy to use - Fancy output with fallback for minimal environments - Pluggable reporters - Consistent command line interface (CLI) experience - Tag support - Redirect `console` and `stdout/stderr` to the consola and easily restore redirect. - Browser support - Pause/Resume support - Mocking support - Spam prevention by throttling logs  ## Installation  Using yarn:  ```bash yarn add consola ```  Using npm:  ```bash npm i consola ```  ## Getting Started  ```js const consola = require('consola')  // See types section for all available types  consola.success('Built!') consola.info('Reporter: Some info') consola.error(new Error('Foo')) ```  Will display in the terminal:  ![Screenshot 2020-01-28 at 14 15 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/73267133-af6b2f00-41d8-11ea-9f16-4a8243d19c43.png)  **NOTE:** Alternatively, you can import consola from source. But don't forget to whitelist it for transpilation:  ```js import consola from 'consola/src/node' import consola from 'consola/src/browser' ```  ## Methods  #### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`  Log to all reporters.  Example: `consola.info('Message')`  A list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).  #### `addReporter(reporter)`  - Aliases: `add`  Register a custom reporter instance.  #### `removeReporter(reporter?)`  - Aliases: `remove`, `clear`  Remove a registered reporter.  If no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.  #### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`  Replace all reporters.  #### `create(options)`  Create a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.  #### `withDefaults(defaults)`  Create a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults  #### `withTag(tag)`  - Aliases: `withScope`  Create a new `Consola` instance with that tag.  #### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`  Globally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.  #### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`  Globally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.  #### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`  Wrap both, std and console.  console uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too. Benefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.  #### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`  - Aliases: `pause`/`resume`  **Globally** pause and resume logs.  Consola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.  #### `mockTypes`  - Aliases: `mock`  Mock all types. Useful for using with tests.  The first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:  ```js consola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn()) ```  Please note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:  ```js const fn = jest.fn() consola.mockTypes(() => fn) ```  If callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won't be mocked.  For example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:  ```js consola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === 'fatal' && jest.fn()) ```  **NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again. This way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.  ## Fields  #### `reporters`  An array of active reporters.  #### `level`  The level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed. List of available levels [here](./src/types.js).  You can set log level using `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable.  ## `logObject`  The `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.  Standard fields:  - `message` - `additional` - `args` - `date` - `tag`  Extra fields:  - `badge`  ## Reporters  Choose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.  By default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.  Available reporters:  - [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js) - [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js) - [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js) - [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)  ### Creating your own reporter  A reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method. To get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.  ## Types  Types are used to actually log messages to the reporters. Each type is attached to a _logging level_.  A list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).  ## Creating a new instance  Consola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere. In case more control is needed, create a new instance.  ```js import consola from 'consola'  const logger = consola.create({     // level: 4,     reporters: [       new consola.JSONReporter()     ],     defaults: {       additionalColor: 'white'     } }) ```  ## Integrations  ### With jest  ```js describe('your-consola-mock-test', () => {   beforeAll(() => {       // Redirect std and console to consola too       // Calling this once is sufficient       consola.wrapAll()     })      beforeEach(() => {       // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove       // calls from before       consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())     })     test('your test', async () => {     // Some code here      // Let's retrieve all messages of `consola.log`     // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument     const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])     expect(consolaMessages).toContain('your message')   })  }) ```  ### With jsdom  ```js {   virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola) } ```  ## License  MIT - Made with 💖 By Nuxt.js team!  <!-- Refs --> [standard-js-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/badge/code%20style/standard/green [standard-js-href]: https://standardjs.com  [npm-version-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/v/consola/latest [npm-version-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola  [npm-downloads-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/dt/consola [npm-downloads-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola  [package-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/packagephobia/install/consola [package-phobia-href]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=consola  [bundle-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/consola [bundle-phobia-href]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=consola"

Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'); cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```    Or without options / local variables:  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'); cons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```    To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:  ```js var cons = require('consolidate')   , name = 'swig';  cons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){   if (err) throw err;   console.log(html); }); ```  ### Promises    Additionally, all templates optionally return a promise if no callback function is provided. The promise represents the eventual result of the template function which will either resolve to a string, compiled from the template, or be rejected. Promises expose a `then` method which registers callbacks to receive the promise’s eventual value and a `catch` method which the reason why the promise could not be fulfilled. Promises allow more synchronous-like code structure and solve issues like race conditions.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate');  cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' })   .then(function (html) {     console.log(html);   })   .catch(function (err) {     throw err;   }); ```  ## Caching   To enable caching simply pass `{ cache: true }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.  When using consolidate directly: `cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi', cache:true }, callback);`  Using Express 3 or higher: `app.locals.cache = true` or set NODE_ENV to 'production' and Express will do this for you.  ## Express 3.x example  ```js var express = require('express')   , cons = require('consolidate')   , app = express();  // assign the swig engine to .html files app.engine('html', cons.swig);  // set .html as the default extension app.set('view engine', 'html'); app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');  var users = []; users.push({ name: 'tobi' }); users.push({ name: 'loki' }); users.push({ name: 'jane' });  app.get('/', function(req, res){   res.render('index', {     title: 'Consolidate.js'   }); });  app.get('/users', function(req, res){   res.render('users', {     title: 'Users',     users: users   }); });  app.listen(3000); console.log('Express server listening on port 3000'); ```  ## Template Engine Instances  Template engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.  ```js var cons = require('consolidate'),   nunjucks = require('nunjucks');  // add nunjucks to requires so filters can be // added and the same instance will be used inside the render method cons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks.configure();  cons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {   return 'bar'; }); ```  ## Notes  * If you're using Nunjucks, please take a look at the `exports.nunjucks.render` function in `lib.consolidate.js`.  You can pass your own engine/environment via `options.nunjucksEnv`, or if you want to support Express you can pass `options.settings.views`, or if you have another use case, pass `options.nunjucks` (see the code for more insight). * You can pass **partials** with `options.partials` * For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader   with `options.loader`. * To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it. * To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition. * The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory. To override this, use `options.includeDir`. * `React` To render content into a html base template (eg. `index.html` of your React app), pass the path of the template with `options.base`.  ## Running tests    Install dev deps:      $ npm install -d    Run the tests:      $ make test  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2011-2016 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

If You   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate   as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You   meet the following conditions:    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices       stating that You changed the files; and    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of       the Derivative Works; and    (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed       as modifying the License.    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with   the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this   License.

Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.     2.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

See documentation on [electron.build](https://www.electron.build).  * NPM packages management:     * [Native application dependencies](https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/) compilation (including [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) support).     * Development dependencies are never included. You don't need to ignore them explicitly.     * [Two package.json structure](https://www.electron.build/tutorials/two-package-structure) is supported, but you are not forced to use it even if you have native production dependencies. * [Code Signing](https://www.electron.build/code-signing) on a CI server or development machine. * [Auto Update](https://www.electron.build/auto-update) ready application packaging. * Numerous target formats:     * All platforms: `7z`, `zip`, `tar.xz`, `tar.7z`, `tar.lz`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, `dir` (unpacked directory).     * [macOS](https://www.electron.build/configuration/mac): `dmg`, `pkg`, `mas`.     * [Linux](https://www.electron.build/configuration/linux): [AppImage](http://appimage.org), [snap](http://snapcraft.io), debian package (`deb`), `rpm`, `freebsd`, `pacman`, `p5p`, `apk`.     * [Windows](https://www.electron.build/configuration/win): `nsis` (Installer), `nsis-web` (Web installer), `portable` (portable app without installation), AppX (Windows Store), MSI, Squirrel.Windows. * [Publishing artifacts](https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish) to GitHub Releases, Amazon S3, DigitalOcean Spaces and Bintray. * Advanced building:     * Pack in a distributable format [already packaged app](https://www.electron.build/#pack-only-in-a-distributable-format).     * Separate [build steps](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1102#issuecomment-271845854).     * Build and publish in parallel, using hard links on CI server to reduce IO and disk space usage.     * [electron-compile](https://github.com/electron/electron-compile) support (compile for release-time on the fly on build). * [Docker](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build#docker) images to build Electron app for Linux or Windows on any platform. * [Proton Native](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration/#proton-native) support. * Downloads all required tools files on demand automatically (e.g. to code sign windows application, to make AppX), no need to setup.  | Question | Answer | |----------|-------| | “I want to configure electron-builder” | [See options](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration) | | “I have a question” | [Open an issue](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues) or [join the chat](https://electron-builder.zulipchat.com/) | | “I found a bug” | [Open an issue](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/new) | | “I want to support development” | [Donate](https://www.electron.build/donate) |  ## Installation [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) is [strongly](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1147#issuecomment-276284477) recommended instead of npm.  `yarn add electron-builder --dev`  ## Quick Setup Guide  [electron-webpack-quick-start](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start) is a recommended way to create a new Electron application. See [Boilerplates](https://www.electron.build/#boilerplates).  1. Specify the standard fields in the application `package.json` — [name](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#Metadata-name), `description`, `version` and [author](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors).  2. Specify the [build](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#build) configuration in the `package.json` as follows:     ```json     'build': {       'appId': 'your.id',       'mac': {         'category': 'your.app.category.type'       }     }     ```    See [all options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration). Option [files](https://www.electron.build/configuration/contents#files) to indicate which files should be packed in the final application, including the entry file, maybe required.  3. Add [icons](https://www.electron.build/icons).  4. Add the [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) key to the development `package.json`:     ```json     'scripts': {       'pack': 'electron-builder --dir',       'dist': 'electron-builder'     }     ```     Then you can run `yarn dist` (to package in a distributable format (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package)) or `yarn pack` (only generates the package directory without really packaging it. This is useful for testing purposes).      To ensure your native dependencies are always matched electron version, simply add script `'postinstall': 'electron-builder install-app-deps'` to your `package.json`.  5. If you have native addons of your own that are part of the application (not as a dependency), set [nodeGypRebuild](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#Configuration-nodeGypRebuild) to `true`.  Please note that everything is packaged into an asar archive [by default](https://electron.build/configuration/configuration#Configuration-asar).  For an app that will be shipped to production, you should sign your application. See [Where to buy code signing certificates](https://www.electron.build/code-signing#where-to-buy-code-signing-certificate).  ## Donate  We do this open source work in our free time.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve for your cryptography operations.  ## Incentive  ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are even more slower.  ## Benchmarks  ```bash $ node benchmarks/index.js Benchmarking: sign elliptic#sign x 262 ops/sec ±0.51% (177 runs sampled) eccjs#sign x 55.91 ops/sec ±0.90% (144 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#sign ======================== Benchmarking: verify elliptic#verify x 113 ops/sec ±0.50% (166 runs sampled) eccjs#verify x 48.56 ops/sec ±0.36% (125 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#verify ======================== Benchmarking: gen elliptic#gen x 294 ops/sec ±0.43% (176 runs sampled) eccjs#gen x 62.25 ops/sec ±0.63% (129 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#gen ======================== Benchmarking: ecdh elliptic#ecdh x 136 ops/sec ±0.85% (156 runs sampled) ------------------------ Fastest is elliptic#ecdh ======================== ```  ## API  ### ECDSA  ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec;  // Create and initialize EC context // (better do it once and reuse it) var ec = new EC('secp256k1');  // Generate keys var key = ec.genKeyPair();  // Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string) var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]; var signature = key.sign(msgHash);  // Export DER encoded signature in Array var derSign = signature.toDER();  // Verify signature console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));  // CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY  var pubPoint = key.getPublic(); var x = pubPoint.getX(); var y = pubPoint.getY();  // Public Key MUST be either: // 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or // 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or // 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y) var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1 var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2 var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3 var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3  // Import public key var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');  // Signature MUST be either: // 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or // 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or // 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or // 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)  var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1 var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2 var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3  // Verify signature console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature)); ```  ### EdDSA  ```javascript var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;  // Create and initialize EdDSA context // (better do it once and reuse it) var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');  // Create key pair from secret var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer  // Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string) var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]; var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();  // Verify signature console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));  // CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY  // Import public key var pub = '0a1af638...'; var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');  // Verify signature var signature = '70bed1...'; console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature)); ```  ### ECDH  ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec; var ec = new EC('curve25519');  // Generate keys var key1 = ec.genKeyPair(); var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();  var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic()); var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());  console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances'); console.log(shared1.toString(16)); console.log(shared2.toString(16)); ```  three and more members: ```javascript var EC = require('elliptic').ec; var ec = new EC('curve25519');  var A = ec.genKeyPair(); var B = ec.genKeyPair(); var C = ec.genKeyPair();  var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate()) var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate()) var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())  var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate()) var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate()) var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())  console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16)) console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16)) console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16)) ```  NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.  ## Supported curves  Elliptic.js support following curve types:  * Short Weierstrass * Montgomery * Edwards * Twisted Edwards  Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:  * `secp256k1` * `p192` * `p224` * `p256` * `p384` * `p521` * `curve25519` * `ed25519`  NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.  ### Implementation details  ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.  All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is provided by [hash.js][2]  ### Related projects  * [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both   browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for   node)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

"errno@0.1.7","https://github.com/rvagg/node-errno","","# node-errno  > Better [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)/[io.js](https://iojs.org) error handling & reporting. Available in npm as *errno*.  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)  * [errno exposed](#errnoexposed) * [Custom errors](#customerrors)  <a name='errnoexposed'></a> ## errno exposed  Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.  **By errno:**  ```js require('errno').errno[3] // → { //     'errno': 3, //     'code': 'EACCES', //     'description': 'permission denied' //   } ```  **By code:**  ```js require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY // → { //     'errno': 53, //     'code': 'ENOTEMPTY', //     'description': 'directory not empty' //   } ```  **Make your errors more descriptive:**  ```js var errno = require('errno')  function errmsg(err) {   var str = 'Error: '   // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno   if (errno.errno[err.errno])     str += errno.errno[err.errno].description   else     str += err.message    // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property   if (err.path)     str += ' [' + err.path + ']'    return str }  var fs = require('fs')  fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {   if (err)     console.log(errmsg(err)) }) ```  **Use as a command line tool:**  ``` ~ $ errno 53 {   'errno': 53,   'code': 'ENOTEMPTY',   'description': 'directory not empty' } ~ $ errno EROFS {   'errno': 56,   'code': 'EROFS',   'description': 'read-only file system' } ~ $ errno foo No such errno/code: 'foo' ```  Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.  You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.  <a name='customerrors'></a> ## Custom errors  Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.  ```js var create = require('errno').custom.createError var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)  // use them! if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')  if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err)) ```  Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:  ```js fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {   if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))   // do something else }) ```  The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.  ## Contributors  * [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI * [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)  ## Copyright & Licence  *Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*  Made available under the MIT licence:  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        'Contribution' shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

'Contributor' shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"esrecurse@4.3.0","https://github.com/estools/esrecurse","Copyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation).  (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.","### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)  Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) recursive traversing functionality.  ### Example Usage  The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(ast, {     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } }); ```  We can use `Visitor` instance.  ```javascript var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({     XXXStatement: function (node) {         this.visit(node.left);         // do something...         this.visit(node.right);     } });  visitor.visit(ast); ```  We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.  ```javascript class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {     constructor()     {         super(null);     }      XXXStatement(node) {     } } ```  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     this.visit(node.left);     // do something...     this.visit(node.right); }; ```  And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.  ```javascript function DerivedVisitor() {     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */); } util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor); DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {     // do something...     this.visitChildren(node); }; ```  The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`. We can use user-defined node types.  ```javascript // This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node. var tree = {     type: 'TestExpression',      // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.     argument: {         type: 'Literal',         value: 20     },      // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.     extended: true }; esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         // Extending the existing traversing rules.         childVisitorKeys: {             // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]             TestExpression: ['argument']         }     } ); ```  We can use the `fallback` option as well. If the `fallback` option is `'iteration'`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: 'iteration'     } ); ```  If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes. Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).  ```javascript esrecurse.visit(     ast,     {         Literal: function (node) {             // do something...         }     },     {         fallback: function (node) {             return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {                 return key !== 'argument'             });         }     } ); ```  ### License  Copyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)  (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.

"estree-walker@2.0.1","https://github.com/Rich-Harris/estree-walker","","# estree-walker  Simple utility for walking an [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compliant AST, such as one generated by [acorn](https://github.com/marijnh/acorn).   ## Installation  ```bash npm i estree-walker ```   ## Usage  ```js var walk = require( 'estree-walker' ).walk; var acorn = require( 'acorn' );  ast = acorn.parse( sourceCode, options ); // https://github.com/acornjs/acorn  walk( ast, {   enter: function ( node, parent, prop, index ) {     // some code happens   },   leave: function ( node, parent, prop, index ) {   	// some code happens   } }); ```  Inside the `enter` function, calling `this.skip()` will prevent the node's children being walked, or the `leave` function (which is optional) being called.  Call `this.replace(new_node)` in either `enter` or `leave` to replace the current node with a new one.  Call `this.remove()` in either `enter` or `leave` to remove the current node.  ## Why not use estraverse?  The ESTree spec is evolving to accommodate ES6/7. I've had a couple of experiences where [estraverse](https://github.com/estools/estraverse) was unable to handle an AST generated by recent versions of acorn, because it hard-codes visitor keys.  estree-walker, by contrast, simply enumerates a node's properties to find child nodes (and child lists of nodes), and is therefore resistant to spec changes. It's also much smaller. (The performance, if you're wondering, is basically identical.)  None of which should be taken as criticism of estraverse, which has more features and has been battle-tested in many more situations, and for which I'm very grateful.   ## License  MIT"

"faye-websocket@0.10.0","https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-node","Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan","# faye-websocket  * Travis CI build: [![Build   status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node) * Autobahn tests: [server](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/servers/),   [client](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/clients/)  This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing [Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction other than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).  It also provides an abstraction for handling [EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than WebSockets.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install faye-websocket ```   ## Handling WebSocket connections in Node  You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this is how you'd implement an echo server:  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     http      = require('http');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {   if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {     var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);          ws.on('message', function(event) {       ws.send(event.data);     });          ws.on('close', function(event) {       console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);       ws = null;     });   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  `WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the `ws.on('message', ...)` line with:  ```js     ws.pipe(ws); ```  Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any buffered messages will be sent to the client.  If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the `onopen` event.  If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns `false`.  ```js ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {   // fires when pong is received }); ```   ## Using the WebSocket client  The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss` protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.  ```js var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),     ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');  ws.on('open', function(event) {   console.log('open');   ws.send('Hello, world!'); });  ws.on('message', function(event) {   console.log('message', event.data); });  ws.on('close', function(event) {   console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);   ws = null; }); ```  The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.  To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy, including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you require. Only the `origin` setting is required.  ```js var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {   proxy: {     origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',     headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},     tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}   } }); ```  The `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).   ## Subprotocol negotiation  The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you construct the socket:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']); ```  On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server supports after the other constructor arguments:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']); ```  If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.   ## Protocol extensions  faye-websocket is based on the [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node) framework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an array of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add [permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):  ```js var deflate = require('permessage-deflate');  var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]}); ```   ## Initialization options  Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in at initialization time, for example:  ```js var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options); var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options); ```  `protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`. `options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:  * `extensions` - an array of   [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)   compatible extensions, as described above * `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to   be sent during the handshake process * `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.   The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB. * `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,   measured in seconds  The client accepts some additional options:  * `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above * `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin   server, this will be passed to   [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) * `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`   ## WebSocket API  Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.  * <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is   established. Event has no attributes. * <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a   message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`   (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames). * <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error   due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,   you do not need to implement error recover. * <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the   server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>   and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer   that closed the connection. * <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a   text or binary message over the connection to the other peer. * <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional   message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received. * <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status   code and reason text, both of which are optional. * <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`   protocol the connection is using. * <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol   the socket is using.   ## Handling EventSource connections in Node  EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API. EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each message has an optional event-type and ID.  ```js var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),     EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,     http        = require('http');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('request', function(request, response) {   if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {     var es = new EventSource(request, response);     console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);          // Periodically send messages     var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);          es.on('close', function() {       clearInterval(loop);       es = null;     });      } else {     // Normal HTTP request     response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});     response.end('Hello');   } });  server.listen(8000); ```  The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification` event with ID `99`:  ```js es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'}); ```  The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:  * <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the   EventSource. * <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the   client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection   to determine which messages need resending.  When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:  * <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the   EventSource response. * <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it   should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect. * <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send   'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts   set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.  For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:  ```js var es = new EventSource(request, response, {   headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},   ping:    15,   retry:   10 }); ```  You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"filelist@1.0.1","https://github.com/mde/filelist","","## FileList  A FileList is a lazy-evaluated list of files. When given a list of glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file list, instead of searching the file structures to find the files, a FileList holds the pattern for latter use.  This allows you to define a FileList to match any number of files, but only search out the actual files when then FileList itself is actually used. The key is that the first time an element of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns are resolved into a real list of file names.  ### Usage  Add files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob patterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array methods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to an actual list of files.  ```javascript var fl = new FileList(); fl.include('test/*.js'); fl.exclude('test/helpers.js'); ```  Use the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this when your inclusions are too broad.  ### Array methods  FileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array methods, including the following:  * join * pop * push * concat * reverse * shift * unshift * slice * splice * sort * filter * forEach * some * every * map * indexOf * lastIndexOf * reduce * reduceRight  When you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList will be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will be invoked on that result.  ### Special `length` method  `length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a property) which returns the number of actual files in the list once it's been resolved.  ### FileList-specific methods  `include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list  `exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex  `resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of files. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array methods is called.  `toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an actual array of filepaths.  `clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used before resolving the list.  `clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules."

"glob-to-regexp@0.3.0","https://github.com/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp","Copyright (c) 2013, Nick Fitzgerald","# Glob To Regular Expression  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fitzgen/glob-to-regexp)  Turn a \*-wildcard style glob (`'*.min.js'`) into a regular expression (`/^.*\.min\.js$/`)!  To match bash-like globs, eg. `?` for any single-character match, `[a-z]` for character ranges, and `{*.html, *.js}` for multiple alternatives, call with `{ extended: true }`.  To obey [globstars `**`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) rules set option `{globstar: true}`. NOTE: This changes the behavior of `*` when `globstar` is `true` as shown below: When `{globstar: true}`: `/foo/**` will match any string that starts with `/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc.  Also, `/foo/**/*.txt` will match any string that starts with `/foo/` and ends with `.txt` like `/foo/bar.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, etc. Whereas `/foo/*` (single `*`, not a globstar) will match strings that start with `/foo/` like `/foo/index.htm`, `/foo/baz.txt` but will not match strings that contain a `/` to the right like `/foo/bar/baz.txt`, `/foo/bar/baz/qux.dat`, etc.  Set flags on the resulting `RegExp` object by adding the `flags` property to the option object, eg `{ flags: 'i' }` for ignoring case.  ## Install      npm install glob-to-regexp  ## Usage ```js var globToRegExp = require('glob-to-regexp'); var re = globToRegExp('p*uck'); re.test('pot luck'); // true re.test('pluck'); // true re.test('puck'); // true  re = globToRegExp('*.min.js'); re.test('http://example.com/jquery.min.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/jquery.min.js.map'); // false  re = globToRegExp('*/www/*.js'); re.test('http://example.com/www/app.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/www/lib/factory-proxy-model-observer.js'); // true  // Extended globs re = globToRegExp('*/www/{*.js,*.html}', { extended: true }); re.test('http://example.com/www/app.js'); // true re.test('http://example.com/www/index.html'); // true ```  ## License  Copyright (c) 2013, Nick Fitzgerald  All rights reserved.

This is broken into its own module in case the behaviour needs to be replicated in other PostCSS plugins (i.e. [CSS Modules Constants](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-constants))  ## API  ```js import replaceSymbols from 'icss-replace-symbols' replaceSymbols(css, translations) ```  Where:  - `css` is the PostCSS tree you're working with - `translations` is an JS object of `symbol: 'replacement'` pairs, where all occurrences of `symbol` are replaced with `replacement`.  ## Behaviour  A symbol is a string of alphanumeric, `-` or `_` characters. A replacement can be any string. They are replaced in the following places:  - In the value of a declaration, i.e. `color: my_symbol;` or `box-shadow: 0 0 blur spread shadow-color` - In a media expression i.e. `@media small {}` or `@media screen and not-large {}`  ## License  ISC  --- Glen Maddern, 2015."

Pay attention that [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.  ##### Tested on  - Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x` - Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node < `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.  Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.  ## Table Of Main Contents  - [Usage](#usage) - [Guide for 2.x -> 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x) - [Contributing](#contributing) - Related Packages   - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.  ## Usage  ```js const ignore = require('ignore') const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/']) ```  ### Filter the given paths  ```js const paths = [   '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out   '.abc/d/e.js'   // included ]  ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js'] ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true ```  ### As the filter function  ```js paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js'] ```  ### Win32 paths will be handled  ```js ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js']) // if the code above runs on windows, the result will be // ['.abc\\d\\e.js'] ```  ## Why another ignore?  - `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.  - `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so   - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.   - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.  - Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:   - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.   - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.   - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.   - Handle trailing whitespaces:     - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).     - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`   - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.  ## Methods  ### .add(pattern) ### .add(patterns)  - **pattern** `String|Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance - **patterns** `Array.<pattern>` Array of ignore patterns.  Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.  Returns `this`  Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.  ```js ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true ```  `pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:  ```js ignore() .add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString()) .filter(filenames) ```  `pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.  ### <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>  REMOVED in `3.x` for now.  To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use  ```js const fs = require('fs')  if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {   ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString()) } ```  instead.   ### .ignores(pathname)  > new in 3.2.0  Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.  ```js ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true ```  ### .filter(paths)  Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.  - **paths** `Array.<path>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.  **NOTICE** that:  - `pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory.  ```js // WRONG ig.ignores('./abc')  // WRONG, for it will never happen. // If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory, // `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`. // ``` // path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc' // ``` ig.ignores('/abc')  // Right ig.ignores('abc')  // Right ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc' ```  - In other words, each `pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.  Suppose the dir structure is:  ``` /path/to/your/repo     |-- a     |   |-- a.js     |     |-- .b     |     |-- .c          |-- .DS_store ```  Then the `paths` might be like this:  ```js [   'a/a.js'   '.b',   '.c/.DS_store' ] ```  Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:  ```js const glob = require('glob')  glob('**', {   // Adds a / character to directory matches.   mark: true }, (err, files) => {   if (err) {     return console.error(err)   }    let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)   console.log(filtered) }) ```  ### .createFilter()  Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.  Returns `function(path)` the filter function.  ****  ## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x  - All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them. - `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed. - `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.  ****  ## Contributing  The code of `node-ignore` is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the `dependencies` field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.  So use `bash install.sh` to install dependencies and `bash test.sh` to run test cases in your local machine.  #### Collaborators  - [SamyPesse](https://github.com/SamyPesse) *Samy Pessé* - [azproduction](https://github.com/azproduction) *Mikhail Davydov* - [TrySound](https://github.com/TrySound) *Bogdan Chadkin* - [JanMattner](https://github.com/JanMattner) *Jan Mattner*"

"imurmurhash@0.1.4","https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js","","iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.  Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script type='text/javascript' src='/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js'></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); ```  Quick Example -------------  ```javascript // Create the initial hash var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');  // Incrementally add text hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');  // All calls can be chained if desired hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');  // Get a result hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b ```  Functions ---------  ### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:  ```javascript // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState = MurmurHash3(); ...  // Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); ```  Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.  ```javascript // Do the whole string at once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328  // Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m = MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) ```  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  License (MIT) ------------- Copyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

GPL version 3 =============                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                        Version 3, 29 June 2007   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                              Preamble    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS    0. Definitions.    'This License' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.    'Copyright' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.    'The Program' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  'Licensees' and 'recipients' may be individuals or organizations.    To 'modify' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a 'modified version' of the earlier work or a work 'based on' the earlier work.    A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.    To 'propagate' a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.    To 'convey' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.    An interactive user interface displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices' to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.    1. Source Code.    The 'source code' for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  'Object code' means any non-source form of a work.    A 'Standard Interface' means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.    The 'System Libraries' of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A 'Major Component', in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.    The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.    2. Basic Permissions.    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified     it, and giving a relevant date.      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is     released under this License and any conditions added under section     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to     'keep intact all notices'.      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your     work need not make them do so.    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium     customarily used for software interchange.      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b.      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no     charge under subsection 6d.    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.    A 'User Product' is either (1) a 'consumer product', which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, 'normally used' refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.    'Installation Information' for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.    7. Additional Terms.    'Additional permissions' are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal     Notices displayed by works containing it; or      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or     authors of the material; or      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on     those licensors and authors.    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 'further restrictions' within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.    8. Termination.    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.    An 'entity transaction' is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.    11. Patents.    A 'contributor' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's 'contributor version'.    A contributor's 'essential patent claims' are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, 'control' includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.    In the following three paragraphs, a 'patent license' is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To 'grant' such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  'Knowingly relying' means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.    A patent license is 'discriminatory' if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.    14. Revised Versions of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    16. Limitation of Liability.    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

If You    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate    as of the date such litigation is filed.  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You    meet the following conditions:     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices        stating that You changed the files; and     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of        the Derivative Works; and     (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed        as modifying the License.     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with    the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"mdn-data@2.0.4","https://github.com/mdn/data","","CC0 1.0 Universal  Statement of Purpose  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an 'owner') of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a 'Work').  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ('Commons') that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the 'Affirmer'), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ('Copyright and Related Rights'). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,   and translate a Work;    ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness   depicted in a Work;    iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in   a Work;    vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal   protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,   including any amended or successor version of such directive); and    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world   based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'Waiver'). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 'License'). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,   surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties   of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,   including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness   for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or   other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not   discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons   that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation   any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer   disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions   or other rights required for any use of the Work.    d.

[The MIT License](http://lauri.rooden.ee/mit-license.txt)","[Build]:    http://img.shields.io/travis/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png [Coverage]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png [1]: https://travis-ci.org/litejs/natural-compare-lite [2]: https://coveralls.io/r/litejs/natural-compare-lite [npm package]: https://npmjs.org/package/natural-compare-lite [GitHub repo]: https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite        @version    1.4.0     @date       2015-10-26     @stability  3 - Stable   Natural Compare &ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2] ===============  Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers in the way a human being would in sort order. This is described as a 'natural ordering'.  ```text Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:     img1.png            img1.png     img10.png           img2.png     img12.png           img10.png     img2.png            img12.png ```  String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same as the given string in sort order. Use it with builtin sort() function.    ### Installation  - In browser  ```html <script src=min.natural-compare.js></script> ```  - In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`  ```javascript require('natural-compare-lite') ```  ### Usage  ```javascript // Simple case sensitive example var a = ['z1.doc', 'z10.doc', 'z17.doc', 'z2.doc', 'z23.doc', 'z3.doc']; a.sort(String.naturalCompare); // ['z1.doc', 'z2.doc', 'z3.doc', 'z10.doc', 'z17.doc', 'z23.doc']  // Use wrapper function for case insensitivity a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase()); })  // In most cases we want to sort an array of objects var a = [ {'street':'350 5th Ave', 'room':'A-1021'}         , {'street':'350 5th Ave', 'room':'A-21046-b'} ];  // sort by street, then by room a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room); })  // When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()), // it is best for performance to keep // transformed key in that object. // There are no need to do text transformation // on each comparision when sorting. var a = [ {'make':'Audi', 'model':'A6'}         , {'make':'Kia',  'model':'Rio'} ];  // sort by make, then by model a.map(function(car){   car.sort_key = (car.make + ' ' + car.model).toLowerCase(); }) a.sort(function(a, b){   return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key); }) ```  - Works well with dates in ISO format eg 'Rev 2012-07-26.doc'.   ### Custom alphabet  It is possible to configure a custom alphabet to achieve a desired order.  ```javascript // Estonian alphabet String.alphabet = 'ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy' ['t', 'z', 'x', 'õ'].sort(String.naturalCompare) // ['z', 't', 'õ', 'x']  // Russian alphabet String.alphabet = 'АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя' ['Ё', 'А', 'Б'].sort(String.naturalCompare) // ['А', 'Б', 'Ё'] ```   External links --------------  -   [GitHub repo][https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite] -   [jsperf test](http://jsperf.com/natural-sort-2/12)   Licence -------  Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Lauri Rooden &lt;lauri@rooden.ee&gt;   [The MIT License](http://lauri.rooden.ee/mit-license.txt)"

"node-forge@0.10.0","https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge","","You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.  The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the Forge project.  If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under that license.  You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.  If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative commercial entities for our efforts.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- New BSD License (3-clause) Copyright (c) 2010, Digital Bazaar, Inc.

Preamble    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The 'Program', below, refers to any such program or work, and a 'work based on the Program' means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 'modification'.)  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     parties under the terms of this License.      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium     customarily used for software interchange; or,      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you     received the program in object code or executable form with such     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 'any later version', you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.            NO WARRANTY    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.   	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.   	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.     2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,  share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's   creator(s) a pint.    3. Code is provided with no warranty.

Takes a string or Buffer:  ```js var fs = require('fs') var parse = require('parse-bmfont-xml')  fs.readFileSync(__dirname+'/Arial.fnt', function(err, data) {   var result = parse(data)   console.log(result.info.face)   // 'Arial'   console.log(result.pages)       // [ 'sheet0.png' ]   console.log(result.chars)       // [ ... char data ... ]   console.log(result.kernings)    // [ ... kernings data ... ] }) ```  The spec for the returned JSON object is [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/bmfont2json/wiki/JsonSpec). The input data should match the spec, see [test/Nexa Light-32.fnt](test/Nexa Light-32.fnt) for an example.  ## See Also  See [text-modules](https://github.com/mattdesl/text-modules) for related modules.  ## Usage  [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/parse-bmfont-ascii.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-bmfont-ascii)  #### `result = parse(data)`  Parses `data`, a string or Buffer that represents ASCII (text) data of an AngelCode BMFont file.

"pn@1.1.0","https://github.com/cscott/node-pn","Copyright (c) 2014-2018 C. Scott Ananian","# pn [![NPM][NPM1]][NPM2]  [![Build Status][1]][2]  The `pn` library gives you the Promise-using node standard library you've always dreamed of.  Think 'Promised Node' when saying it.  Just about every node standard library method that takes a callback will now return a `Promise` iff no callback is supplied.  But existing code that passes callbacks will still work fine --- and fast:  No unnecessary `Promise`s are created if you supply a callback.  The wrappers are generated automatically by a script, with a table to handle exceptions and odd cases.  See below for more details.  ## Installation ``` npm install pn ``` ## Usage ``` var fs = require('pn/fs'); fs.writeFile('foo', 'bar', 'utf-8').then(function() { console.log('done'); }); // But you can use callbacks, too -- existing code won't break. fs.writeFile('foo', 'bat', 'utf-8', function(err) { console.log('yay'); }); ```  This library uses node native promises (ie `global.Promise`) by default, and thus works with node >= 0.11.  You can use [`core-js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/core-js) or [`es6-shim`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-shim) to add ES6 Promises to earlier versions of node, for example: ``` require('es6-shim'); var fs = require('pn/fs'); ``` Just be sure that `es6-shim` is loaded before the `pn` package in that case.  You might also want to look into packages like [`prfun`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/prfun) which add some helpers to make working with native promises much more fun.  In particular, the `Promise#done` method is very useful when debugging, at least until v8's native Promise debugging capabilities are completed.  ## Custom Promise types  You can also specify a custom `Promise` type to use, as follows: ``` var MyPromise = require('prfun');  // Use prfun's Promises, for example. require('pn/_promise')(MyPromise); // This only needs to be done once. ```  ## Exceptions and odd cases  The wrappers are automatically generated by `scripts/generate.js`; there is a table in that file which specifies all the odd cases.  In general: if the node API has a callback which takes multiple value arguments, the `Promise` returned will be an object with named fields corresponding to the different values. If the node API takes a callback *and* returns a value, `pn` will return the original value with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the callback.  Combining these two cases: ``` var child_process = require('pn/child_process'); var cp = child_process.execFile('true'); console.log('pid', cp.pid); cp.promise.then(function(result) {   console.log('stdout: ', result.stdout);   console.log('stderr: ', result.stderr); }); ```  * `child_process`: The `exec` and `execFile` methods promise a object   with fields named `stdout` and `stderr`.  They return a `ChildProcess`   object with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the   callback. * `crypto`: The `randomBytes` and `pseudoRandomBytes` methods are   now always asynchronous, returning a `Promise` if no callback   is supplied.  Use the new `randomBytesSync` and `pseudoRandomBytesSync`   methods if you want synchronous computation.  *This is backwards   incompatible with existing node code.* * `dns`: The `lookupService` method promises an object with   fields named `hostname` and `service`. * `fs`: The `exists` method doesn't pass an error to its callback.   The promisied version will never reject.  The `write` method promises   an object with fields named `written` and `data`.  The `read` method   promises an object with fields named `read` and `data`. * `http`, `https`: The `request` and `get` methods return a `ClientRequest`   object with a nonenumerable field named `promise`, which will   resolve to an `IncomingMessage` object. * `process`: You can defer computation to the next tick with   `require('pn/process').nextTick().then(function(){...})` * `tls`: The `connect` and `createServer` return objects with a   nonenumerable field named `promise`.  There are a few object methods which are not promisified by this package: * `domain`: `Domain#bind`, `Domain#intercept` * `http`,`https`: `ClientRequest#setTimeout`, `IncomingMessage#setTimeout`,   `Server#setTimeout`, `ServerResponse#setTimeout`, `Server#listen`,   `Server#close` * `net`: `Server#listen`, `Server#close`, `Server#getConnections`,   `Socket#write`, `Socket#setTimeout` * `readline`: `Interface#question` * `stream`: `Writable#write`, `Writable#end` * `dgram`: `Socket#send`, `Socket#bind`.  ## Related packages  Here are some other packages with similar aims: * [`promised-node`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/promised-node) * [`then-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/then-fs) * [`final-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/final-fs)  ## License  Copyright (c) 2014-2018 C.

"pnp-webpack-plugin@1.6.4","https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin","","# <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/icon-square-small.png' height='40' align='right' /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for Webpack  [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin) [![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)  *This plugin is also available for Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve)), and TypeScript ([ts-pnp](https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp))*  ## Installation  ``` yarn add -D pnp-webpack-plugin ```  ## Usage  Simply add the plugin to both the `resolver` and `resolveLoader`:  ```js const PnpWebpackPlugin = require(`pnp-webpack-plugin`);  module.exports = {   resolve: {     plugins: [       PnpWebpackPlugin,     ],   },   resolveLoader: {     plugins: [       PnpWebpackPlugin.moduleLoader(module),     ],   }, }; ```  The `resolve` entry will take care of correctly resolving the dependencies required by your program, and the `resolveLoader` entry will help Webpack find the location of the loaders on the disk. Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.  In case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:  ```js module.exports = {   module: {     rules: [{       test: /\.js$/,       loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),     }]   }, }; ```  ## License (MIT)  > **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison** > > Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: > > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. > > THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 -->  ## Wut? Poppers?  A popper is an element on the screen which 'pops out' from the natural flow of your application.   Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.   ## So, yet another tooltip library?  Well, basically, **no**.   Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.    The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers** (similar to middlewares or plugins).   The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).  Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.   It's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).  ### Popper.js  This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to the poppers.  Some of the key points are:  - Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!); - Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries; - Supports Shadow DOM elements; - Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;  Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!  Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).   ### Tooltip.js  Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects, we created **Tooltip.js**.   It's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.   Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be easy to integrate it in your projects.   The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.  Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).   ## Installation Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:  | Source |                                                                                  | |:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   | | yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             | | NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  | | Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     | | unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     | | cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |  Tooltip.js as well:  | Source |                                                                                  | |:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  | | yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            | | Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   | | unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   | | cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |  \*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.   For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).  ### Dist targets  Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.  - UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals; - ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec; - ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;  Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.  ## Usage  Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button  ```js var reference = document.querySelector('.my-button'); var popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper'); var anotherPopper = new Popper(     reference,     popper,     {         // popper options here     } ); ```  ### Callbacks  Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after the popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.  ```js const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button'); const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper'); new Popper(reference, popper, {     onCreate: (data) => {         // data is an object containing all the informations computed         // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow         // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation     },     onUpdate: (data) => {         // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates     } }); ```  ### Writing your own modifiers  Popper.js is based on a 'plugin-like' architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated 'modifiers'.   A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.    To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)   ### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration  Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.   Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier, you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using your library of choice.    For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.  Alternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and integrate Popper.js by yourself!  ```js function applyReactStyle(data) {     // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper };  const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button'); const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper'); new Popper(reference, popper, {     modifiers: {         applyStyle: { enabled: false },         applyReactStyle: {             enabled: true,             fn: applyReactStyle,             order: 800,         },     }, });  ```  ### Migration from Popper.js v0  Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to Popper.js v1.    https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62  Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.  ### Performances  Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).   This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.  ## Notes  ### Libraries using Popper.js  The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to be used in 3rd party libraries.    Visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.   ### Credits I want to thank some friends and projects for the work they did:  - [@AndreaScn](https://github.com/AndreaScn) for his work on the GitHub Page and the manual testing he did during the development; - [@vampolo](https://github.com/vampolo) for the original idea and for the name of the library; - [Sysdig](https://github.com/Draios) for all the awesome things I learned during these years that made it possible for me to write this library; - [Tether.js](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for having inspired me in writing a positioning library ready for the real world; - [The Contributors](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/graphs/contributors) for their much appreciated Pull Requests and bug reports; - **you** for the star you'll give to this project and for being so awesome to give this project a try 🙂  ### Copyright and license Code and documentation copyright 2016 **Federico Zivolo**.

"run-queue@1.0.3","https://github.com/iarna/run-queue","","# run-queue  A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.  ```js const RunQueue = require('run-queue')  const queue = new RunQueue({   maxConcurrency: 1 })  queue.add(1, example, [-1]) for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {   queue.add(0, example, [ii]) } const finished = [] queue.run().then(   console.log(finished) })  function example (num, next) {   setTimeout(() => {     finished.push(num)     next()   }, 5 - Math.abs(num)) } ```  would output  ``` [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ] ```  If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:  ``` [ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ] ```  The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the next priority level is run.  See [PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:  ``` [ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ] ```  ## API  ### const queue = new RunQueue(options)  Create a new queue. Options may contain:  * maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once. * Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.  ### queue.add (prio, fn, args)  Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn` with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.  ### queue.run ()  Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected with that error and no further queue running will be done.  ## PRIORITIES  Priorities are any integer value >= 0.  Lowest is executed first.  Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.  This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0` must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0` queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs complete."

This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works in the following environments:  * Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an   AMD loader such as RequireJS)  * Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)  * With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher  ## Node      $ npm install source-map  ## Building from Source (for everywhere else)  Install Node and then run      $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git     $ cd source-map     $ npm link .  Next, run      $ node Makefile.dryice.js  This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:  * `dist/source-map.js` - The unminified browser version.  * `dist/source-map.min.js` - The minified browser version.  * `dist/SourceMap.jsm` - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.  ## Examples  ### Consuming a source map  ```js var rawSourceMap = {   version: 3,   file: 'min.js',   names: ['bar', 'baz', 'n'],   sources: ['one.js', 'two.js'],   sourceRoot: 'http://example.com/www/js/',   mappings: 'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA' };  var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);  console.log(smc.sources); // [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js', //   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]  console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({   line: 2,   column: 28 })); // { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js', //   line: 2, //   column: 10, //   name: 'n' }  console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({   source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',   line: 2,   column: 10 })); // { line: 2, column: 28 }  smc.eachMapping(function (m) {   // ... }); ```  ### Generating a source map  In depth guide: [**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)  #### With SourceNode (high level API)  ```js function compile(ast) {   switch (ast.type) {   case 'BinaryExpression':     return new SourceNode(       ast.location.line,       ast.location.column,       ast.location.source,       [compile(ast.left), ' + ', compile(ast.right)]     );   case 'Literal':     return new SourceNode(       ast.location.line,       ast.location.column,       ast.location.source,       String(ast.value)     );   // ...   default:     throw new Error('Bad AST');   } }  var ast = parse('40 + 2', 'add.js'); console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({   file: 'add.js' })); // { code: '40 + 2', //   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] } ```  #### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)  ```js var map = new SourceMapGenerator({   file: 'source-mapped.js' });  map.addMapping({   generated: {     line: 10,     column: 35   },   source: 'foo.js',   original: {     line: 33,     column: 2   },   name: 'christopher' });  console.log(map.toString()); // '{'version':3,'file':'source-mapped.js','sources':['foo.js'],'names':['christopher'],'mappings':';;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA'}' ```  ## API  Get a reference to the module:  ```js // NodeJS var sourceMap = require('source-map');  // Browser builds var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;  // Inside Firefox let sourceMap = {}; Components.utils.import('resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm', sourceMap); ```  ### SourceMapConsumer  A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position in the generated source.  #### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)  The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be `JSON.parse`'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the following attributes:  * `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.  * `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.  * `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual   mappings.  * `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.  * `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.  * `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.  * `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()  Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is inclusive.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)  Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source.  * `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or   `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest   element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,   respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to   `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.  and an object is returned with the following properties:  * `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not   available.  * `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is   not available.  * `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this   information is not available.  * `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)  Returns the generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `source`: The filename of the original source.  * `line`: The line number in the original source.  * `column`: The column number in the original source.  and an object is returned with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)  Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column that has any offsets.  The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `source`: The filename of the original source.  * `line`: The line number in the original source.  * `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.  and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()  Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in the source map, false otherwise.  In other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)` will succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])  Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only argument is the URL of the original source file.  If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is thrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned instead.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)  Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a generated line/column in this source map.  * `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the   form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,   name }`  * `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`   every time that `callback` is called.  * `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or   `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over   the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the   original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to   `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.  ### SourceMapGenerator  An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being built incrementally.  #### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])  You may pass an object with the following properties:  * `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is   associated with.  * `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.  * `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as   they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with   discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when   running tests, if possible.  #### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)  Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer  * `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)  Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object should have the following properties:  * `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.  * `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.  * `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).  * `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)  Set the source content for an original source file.  * `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.  * `sourceContent` the content of the source file.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])  Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap. Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.  * `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.  * `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.   If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.   Otherwise an error will be thrown.  * `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap   to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.    This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same   directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source   paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten   relative to the SourceMap.    If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,   thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()  Renders the source map being generated to a string.  ### SourceNode  SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and column information associated between those snippets and the original source code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might use before outputting the generated JS and source map.  #### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])  * `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if   it isn't associated with an original line.  * `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null   if it isn't associated with an original column.  * `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.  * `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see   below.  * `name`: Optional. The original identifier.  #### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])  Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.  * `code`: The generated code  * `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code  * `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`   should be relative to.  #### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)  Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.  * `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of    `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.  #### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)  Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.  * `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of    `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.  #### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)  Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the `SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.  * `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file  * `sourceContent`: The content of the source file  #### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)  Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and the its original associated source's line/column location.  * `fn`: The traversal function.  #### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)  Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each source file content and is passed the filename and source content.  * `fn`: The traversal function.  #### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)  Like `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator between each of this source node's children.  * `sep`: The separator.  #### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)  Call `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful for trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.  * `pattern`: The pattern to replace.  * `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.  #### SourceNode.prototype.toString()  Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.  #### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])  Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and original sources.  The arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.  ## Tests  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)  Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.  To add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js` and export your test functions with names that start with 'test', for example  ```js exports['test doing the foo bar'] = function (assert, util) {   ... }; ```  The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.  The `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.  The `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have access to the following assertion functions:  * `doesNotThrow`  * `equal`  * `ok`  * `strictEqual`  * `throws`  (The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the tests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is shimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)

"spdy@4.0.2","https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy","Copyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.","# SPDY Server for node.js  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/spdy.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/spdy) [![dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy/status.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/spdy-http2/node-spdy) [![Standard - JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://standardjs.com/) [![Waffle](https://img.shields.io/badge/track-waffle-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://waffle.io/spdy-http2/node-spdy)  With this module you can create [HTTP2][0] / [SPDY][1] servers in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https (for browsers that don't support neither HTTP2, nor SPDY yet).  This module named `spdy` but it [provides](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/269#issuecomment-239014184) support for both http/2 (h2) and spdy (2,3,3.1). Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.  ## Usage  ### Examples  Server: ```javascript var spdy = require('spdy'),     fs = require('fs');  var options = {   // Private key   key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),    // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)   cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),    // **optional** SPDY-specific options   spdy: {     protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],     plain: false,      // **optional**     // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the     // headers of every request.     // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that     // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR     'x-forwarded-for': true,      connection: {       windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size        // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy       autoSpdy31: false     }   } };  var server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {   res.writeHead(200);   res.end('hello world!'); });  server.listen(3000); ```  Client: ```javascript var spdy = require('spdy'); var https = require('https');  var agent = spdy.createAgent({   host: 'www.google.com',   port: 443,    // Optional SPDY options   spdy: {     plain: false,     ssl: true,      // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR     'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'   } });  https.get({   host: 'www.google.com',   agent: agent }, function(response) {   console.log('yikes');   // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request   // ...   // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server   // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!   agent.close(); }).end(); ```  Please note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level errors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe to the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:  ```javascript var agent = spdy.createAgent({   host: 'www.google.com',   port: 443 }).once('error', function (err) {   this.emit(err); }); ```  #### Push streams  It is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_ the client requests it.  ```javascript spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {   var stream = res.push('/main.js', {     status: 200, // optional     method: 'GET', // optional     request: {       accept: '*/*'     },     response: {       'content-type': 'application/javascript'     }   });   stream.on('error', function() {   });   stream.end('alert('hello from push stream!');');    res.end('<script src='/main.js'></script>'); }).listen(3000); ```  [PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response object.  The signature of the `push()` method is:  `.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`  Second argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response. `callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a [Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.  Client usage: ```javascript var agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ }); var req = http.get({   host: 'www.google.com',   agent: agent }, function(response) { }); req.on('push', function(stream) {   stream.on('error', function(err) {     // Handle error   });   // Read data from stream }); ```  NOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()` callback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in uncaught exception and crash your program.  #### Trailing headers  Server usage: ```javascript function (req, res) {   // Send trailing headers to client   res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });    // On client's trailing headers   req.on('trailers', function(headers) {     // ...   }); } ```  Client usage: ```javascript var req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {   // On server's trailing headers   res.on('trailers', function(headers) {     // ...   }); }); req.write('stuff'); req.addTrailers({ /* ... */ }); req.end(); ```  #### Options  All options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.  Additional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:  * `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether   to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet. * `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used   as a `base` class for created server. * `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA   chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about   interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.   (defaults to 8192) * `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:   `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`) * `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition, * `maxStreams` - set '[maximum concurrent streams][3]' protocol option  ### API  API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another function as base class for SPDYServer.  ```javascript spdy.createServer(   [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],   { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument   [request listener] ).listen([port], [host], [callback]); ```  Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three custom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy` is `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is `false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`, `3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).   #### Contributors  * [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny) * [Chris Strom](https://github.com/eee-c) * [François de Metz](https://github.com/francois2metz) * [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik) * [Roberto Peon](https://github.com/grmocg) * [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t) * [Jesse Cravens](https://github.com/jessecravens)  #### LICENSE  This software is licensed under the MIT License.

To do an in-place sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:  ```js const arr = [10, 1, 5] stable(arr) === arr          // => false stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true ```  A comparator function can be specified:  ```js // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number. // This demonstrates the default behavior. const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b) stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']  // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true. // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically. const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10] ```  #### License  Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.

"string-hash@1.1.3","https://github.com/darkskyapp/string-hash","","string-hash ===========  A fast string hashing function for Node.JS. The particular algorithm is quite similar to `djb2`, by Dan Bernstein and available [here](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html). Differences include iterating over the string *backwards* (as that is faster in JavaScript) and using the XOR operator instead of the addition operator (as described at that page and because it obviates the need for modular arithmetic in JavaScript).  The hashing function returns a number between 0 and 4294967295 (inclusive).  Thanks to [cscott](https://github.com/cscott) for reminding us how integers work in JavaScript.

For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a 'NOTICE' text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an 'AS IS' BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Correctly handles multi-byte characters and surrogate pairs.  A browser implementation that doesn't use `Buffer.byteLength` is provided to minimize build size.  ## Example  ```js var truncate = require('truncate-utf8-bytes') var str = 'a☃' // a = 1 byte, ☃ = 3 bytes console.log(truncate(str, 2)) // -> 'a' ```  ## API  ### `var truncate = require('truncate-utf8-bytes')`  *When using browserify or webpack*, this automatically resolves to an implementation that does not use `Buffer.byteLength`.  ### `truncate(string, length)`  Returns `string` truncated to at most `length` bytes in length."

If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*  This package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.  ```js import {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp'; import * as ts from 'typescript';  function createCompilerHost(   compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions, ): ts.CompilerHost {   const compilerHost = {     resolveModuleNames,     resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,   };    return compilerHost;    function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {     return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {       return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;     });   }    function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {     return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {       return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;     });   } } ```  ## License (MIT)  > **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison** > > Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: > > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. > > THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

"uniqs@2.0.0","https://github.com/fgnass/uniqs","","[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs)  ### Tiny utility to create unions and de-duplicated lists.  Example:  ```js var uniqs = require('uniqs');  var foo = { foo: 23 }; var list = [3, 2, 2, 1, foo, foo];  uniqs(list); // => [3, 2, 1, { foo: 23 }] ```  You can pass multiple lists to create a union:  ```js uniqs([2, 1, 1], [2, 3, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2]); // => [2, 1, 3, 4] ```  Passing individual items works too: ```js uniqs(3, 2, 2, [1, 1, 2]); // => [3, 2, 1] ```  ### Summary  * Uniqueness is defined based on strict object equality. * The lists do not need to be sorted. * The resulting array contains the items in the order of their first appearance.  ### About  This package has been written to accompany utilities like [flatten](https://npmjs.org/package/flatten) as alternative to full-blown libraries like underscore or lodash.  The implementation is optimized for simplicity rather than performance and looks like this:  ```js module.exports = function uniqs() {   var list = Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arguments);   return list.filter(function(item, i) {     return i == list.indexOf(item);   }); }; ```  ### License MIT"

By default, this module defers to `Buffer.byteLength`. A browser implementation is also provided that doesn't use `Buffer.byteLength` minimize build size.  ## Example  ```js var getLength = require('utf8-byte-length') console.log(truncate('a☃', 2)) // a = 1 byte, ☃ = 3 bytes // -> 4 ```  ## API  ### `var getLength = require('utf8-byte-length')`  *When using browserify or webpack*, this automatically resolves to an implementation that does not use `Buffer.byteLength`.  ### `getLength(string)`  Returns the byte length of `string`. Throws an error if `string` is not a string."

"vue-template-es2015-compiler@1.9.1","https://github.com/vuejs/vue-template-es2015-compiler","","This is an internal package used by `vue-loader` and `vueify`. It processes the raw render functions generated by `vue-template-compiler` to:  1. add support to ES2015 features in template expressions via Buble. (see [supported features here](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features)).  **Note:** since version 1.8.0, object rest spread usage inside templates are transpiled to `Object.assign` calls by default. This means if you need to support IE, you will need to polyfill `Object.assign`. (Latest version of Vue CLI will do this for you).  2. remove the `with` block inside render functions to make it strict-mode compliant. This is performed only at build time so that the base template compiler can be extremely small and lightweight.  The buble implementation is built from a fork at https://github.com/yyx990803/buble"

"vue@3.0.0","https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next","","# vue  ## Which dist file to use?  ### From CDN or without a Bundler  - **`vue(.runtime).global(.prod).js`**:   - For direct use via `<script src='...'>` in the browser. Exposes the `Vue` global.   - Note that global builds are not [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds.  They are built as [IIFEs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) and is only meant for direct use via `<script src='...'>`.   - In-browser template compilation:     - **`vue.global.js`** is the 'full' build that includes both the compiler and the runtime so it supports compiling templates on the fly.     - **`vue.runtime.global.js`** contains only the runtime and requires templates to be pre-compiled during a build step.   - Inlines all Vue core internal packages - i.e. it's a single file with no dependencies on other files. This means you **must** import everything from this file and this file only to ensure you are getting the same instance of code.   - Contains hard-coded prod/dev branches, and the prod build is pre-minified. Use the `*.prod.js` files for production.  - **`vue(.runtime).esm-browser(.prod).js`**:   - For usage via native ES modules imports (in browser via `<script type='module'>`.   - Shares the same runtime compilation, dependency inlining and hard-coded prod/dev behavior with the global build.  ### With a Bundler  - **`vue(.runtime).esm-bundler.js`**:    - For use with bundlers like `webpack`, `rollup` and `parcel`.   - Leaves prod/dev branches with `process.env.NODE_ENV` guards (must be replaced by bundler)   - Does not ship minified builds (to be done together with the rest of the code after bundling)   - Imports dependencies (e.g. `@vue/runtime-core`, `@vue/runtime-compiler`)     - Imported dependencies are also `esm-bundler` builds and will in turn import their dependencies (e.g. `@vue/runtime-core` imports `@vue/reactivity`)     - This means you **can** install/import these deps individually without ending up with different instances of these dependencies, but you must make sure they all resolve to the same version.   - In-browser template compilation:     - **`vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js` (default)** is runtime only, and requires all templates to be pre-compiled. This is the default entry for bundlers (via `module` field in `package.json`) because when using a bundler templates are typically pre-compiled (e.g. in `*.vue` files).     - **`vue.esm-bundler.js`**: includes the runtime compiler. Use this if you are using a bundler but still want runtime template compilation (e.g. in-DOM templates or templates via inline JavaScript strings). You will need to configure your bundler to alias `vue` to this file.    #### Bundler Build Feature Flags    Starting with 3.0.0-rc.3, `esm-bundler` builds now exposes global feature flags that can be overwritten at compile time:    - `__VUE_OPTIONS_API__` (enable/disable Options API support, default: `true`)   - `__VUE_PROD_DEVTOOLS__` (enable/disable devtools support in production, default: `false`)    The build will work without configuring these flags, however it is **strongly recommended** to properly configure them in order to get proper tree-shaking in the final bundle. To configure these flags:    - webpack: use [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/)   - Rollup: use [@rollup/plugin-replace](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/replace)   - Vite: configured by default, but can be overwritten using the [`define` option](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/a4133c073e640b17276b2de6e91a6857bdf382e1/src/node/config.ts#L72-L76)    Note: the replacement value **must be boolean literals** and cannot be strings, otherwise the bundler/minifier will not be able to properly evaluate the conditions.  ### For Server-Side Rendering  - **`vue.cjs(.prod).js`**:   - For use in Node.js server-side rendering via `require()`.   - If you bundle your app with webpack with `target: 'node'` and properly externalize `vue`, this is the build that will be loaded.   - The dev/prod files are pre-built, but the appropriate file is automatically required based on `process.env.NODE_ENV`."

License Grants and Conditions --------------------------------  2.1. Grants  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or     as part of a Larger Work; and  (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its     Contributions or its Contributor Version.  2.2. Effective Date  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;     or  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor     Version); or  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of     its Contributions.  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).  2.4. Subsequent Licenses  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).  2.5. Representation  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.  2.6. Fair Use  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.  2.7. Conditions  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.  3. Responsibilities -------------------  3.1. Distribution of Source Form  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4. Notices  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation ---------------------------------------------------  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  5. Termination --------------  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.  ************************************************************************ *                                                                      * *  6.

Litigation -------------  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.  9. Miscellaneous ----------------  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.  10. Versions of the License ---------------------------  10.1. New Versions  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  10.2. Effect of New Versions  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.  10.3. Modified Versions  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.  Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice -------------------------------------------    This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public   License, v. 2.0.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.  Exhibit B - 'Incompatible With Secondary Licenses' Notice ---------------------------------------------------------    This Source Code Form is 'Incompatible With Secondary Licenses', as   defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0."

"websocket-driver@0.6.5","https://github.com/faye/websocket-driver-node","Copyright (c) 2010-2016 James Coglan","# websocket-driver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-driver-node)  This module provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket protocols that can be hooked up to any I/O stream. It aims to simplify things by decoupling the protocol details from the I/O layer, such that users only need to implement code to stream data in and out of it without needing to know anything about how the protocol actually works. Think of it as a complete WebSocket system with pluggable I/O.  Due to this design, you get a lot of things for free. In particular, if you hook this module up to some I/O object, it will do all of this for you:  * Select the correct server-side driver to talk to the client * Generate and send both server- and client-side handshakes * Recognize when the handshake phase completes and the WS protocol begins * Negotiate subprotocol selection based on `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` * Negotiate and use extensions via the   [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)   module * Buffer sent messages until the handshake process is finished * Deal with proxies that defer delivery of the draft-76 handshake body * Notify you when the socket is open and closed and when messages arrive * Recombine fragmented messages * Dispatch text, binary, ping, pong and close frames * Manage the socket-closing handshake process * Automatically reply to ping frames with a matching pong * Apply masking to messages sent by the client  This library was originally extracted from the [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project but now aims to provide simple WebSocket support for any Node-based project.   ## Installation  ``` $ npm install websocket-driver ```   ## Usage  This module provides protocol drivers that have the same interface on the server and on the client. A WebSocket driver is an object with two duplex streams attached; one for incoming/outgoing messages and one for managing the wire protocol over an I/O stream. The full API is described below.   ### Server-side with HTTP  A Node webserver emits a special event for 'upgrade' requests, and this is where you should handle WebSockets. You first check whether the request is a WebSocket, and if so you can create a driver and attach the request's I/O stream to it.  ```js var http = require('http'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var server = http.createServer();  server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {   if (!websocket.isWebSocket(request)) return;    var driver = websocket.http(request);    driver.io.write(body);   socket.pipe(driver.io).pipe(socket);    driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {     console.log('Got a message', message);   });    driver.start(); }); ```  Note the line `driver.io.write(body)` - you must pass the `body` buffer to the socket driver in order to make certain versions of the protocol work.   ### Server-side with TCP  You can also handle WebSocket connections in a bare TCP server, if you're not using an HTTP server and don't want to implement HTTP parsing yourself.  The driver will emit a `connect` event when a request is received, and at this point you can detect whether it's a WebSocket and handle it as such. Here's an example using the Node `net` module:  ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var server = net.createServer(function(connection) {   var driver = websocket.server();    driver.on('connect', function() {     if (websocket.isWebSocket(driver)) {       driver.start();     } else {       // handle other HTTP requests     }   });    driver.on('close', function() { connection.end() });   connection.on('error', function() {});    connection.pipe(driver.io).pipe(connection);    driver.messages.pipe(driver.messages); });  server.listen(4180); ```  In the `connect` event, the driver gains several properties to describe the request, similar to a Node request object, such as `method`, `url` and `headers`. However you should remember it's not a real request object; you cannot write data to it, it only tells you what request data we parsed from the input.  If the request has a body, it will be in the `driver.body` buffer, but only as much of the body as has been piped into the driver when the `connect` event fires.   ### Client-side  Similarly, to implement a WebSocket client you just need to make a driver by passing in a URL. After this you use the driver API as described below to process incoming data and send outgoing data.   ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),     tcp = net.connect(80, 'www.example.com');  tcp.pipe(driver.io).pipe(tcp);  tcp.on('connect', function() {   driver.start(); });  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {   console.log('Got a message', message); }); ```  Client drivers have two additional properties for reading the HTTP data that was sent back by the server:  * `driver.statusCode` - the integer value of the HTTP status code * `driver.headers` - an object containing the response headers   ### HTTP Proxies  The client driver supports connections via HTTP proxies using the `CONNECT` method. Instead of sending the WebSocket handshake immediately, it will send a `CONNECT` request, wait for a `200` response, and then proceed as normal.  To use this feature, call `driver.proxy(url)` where `url` is the origin of the proxy, including a username and password if required. This produces a duplex stream that you should pipe in and out of your TCP connection to the proxy server. When the proxy emits `connect`, you can then pipe `driver.io` to your TCP stream and call `driver.start()`.  ```js var net = require('net'),     websocket = require('websocket-driver');  var driver = websocket.client('ws://www.example.com/socket'),     proxy  = driver.proxy('http://username:password@proxy.example.com'),     tcp    = net.connect(80, 'proxy.example.com');  tcp.pipe(proxy).pipe(tcp, {end: false});  tcp.on('connect', function() {   proxy.start(); });  proxy.on('connect', function() {   driver.io.pipe(tcp).pipe(driver.io);   driver.start(); });  driver.messages.on('data', function(message) {   console.log('Got a message', message); }); ```  The proxy's `connect` event is also where you should perform a TLS handshake on your TCP stream, if you are connecting to a `wss:` endpoint.  In the event that proxy connection fails, `proxy` will emit an `error`. You can inspect the proxy's response via `proxy.statusCode` and `proxy.headers`.  ```js proxy.on('error', function(error) {   console.error(error.message);   console.log(proxy.statusCode);   console.log(proxy.headers); }); ```  Before calling `proxy.start()` you can set custom headers using `proxy.setHeader()`:  ```js proxy.setHeader('User-Agent', 'node'); proxy.start(); ```   ### Driver API  Drivers are created using one of the following methods:  ```js driver = websocket.http(request, options) driver = websocket.server(options) driver = websocket.client(url, options) ```  The `http` method returns a driver chosen using the headers from a Node HTTP request object. The `server` method returns a driver that will parse an HTTP request and then decide which driver to use for it using the `http` method. The `client` method always returns a driver for the RFC version of the protocol with masking enabled on outgoing frames.  The `options` argument is optional, and is an object. It may contain the following fields:  * `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.   The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB. * `protocols` - an array of strings representing acceptable subprotocols for use   over the socket. The driver will negotiate one of these to use via the   `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header if supported by the other peer.  A driver has two duplex streams attached to it:  * <b>`driver.io`</b> - this stream should be attached to an I/O socket like a   TCP stream. Pipe incoming TCP chunks to this stream for them to be parsed, and   pipe this stream back into TCP to send outgoing frames. * <b>`driver.messages`</b> - this stream emits messages received over the   WebSocket.  Writing to it sends messages to the other peer by emitting frames   via the `driver.io` stream.  All drivers respond to the following API methods, but some of them are no-ops depending on whether the client supports the behaviour.  Note that most of these methods are commands: if they produce data that should be sent over the socket, they will give this to you by emitting `data` events on the `driver.io` stream.  #### `driver.on('open', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when the socket becomes open.  #### `driver.on('message', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when a message is received. `event` will have a `data` attribute containing either a string in the case of a text message or a `Buffer` in the case of a binary message.  You can also listen for messages using the `driver.messages.on('data')` event, which emits strings for text messages and buffers for binary messages.  #### `driver.on('error', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when a protocol error occurs due to the other peer sending an invalid byte sequence. `event` will have a `message` attribute describing the error.  #### `driver.on('close', function(event) {})`  Adds a callback to execute when the socket becomes closed. The `event` object has `code` and `reason` attributes.  #### `driver.addExtension(extension)`  Registers a protocol extension whose operation will be negotiated via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. `extension` is any extension compatible with the [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node) framework.  #### `driver.setHeader(name, value)`  Sets a custom header to be sent as part of the handshake response, either from the server or from the client. Must be called before `start()`, since this is when the headers are serialized and sent.  #### `driver.start()`  Initiates the protocol by sending the handshake - either the response for a server-side driver or the request for a client-side one. This should be the first method you invoke.  Returns `true` if and only if a handshake was sent.  #### `driver.parse(string)`  Takes a string and parses it, potentially resulting in message events being emitted (see `on('message')` above) or in data being sent to `driver.io`.  You should send all data you receive via I/O to this method by piping a stream into `driver.io`.  #### `driver.text(string)`  Sends a text message over the socket. If the socket handshake is not yet complete, the message will be queued until it is. Returns `true` if the message was sent or queued, and `false` if the socket can no longer send messages.  This method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(string)`.  #### `driver.binary(buffer)`  Takes a `Buffer` and sends it as a binary message. Will queue and return `true` or `false` the same way as the `text` method. It will also return `false` if the driver does not support binary messages.  This method is equivalent to `driver.messages.write(buffer)`.  #### `driver.ping(string = '', function() {})`  Sends a ping frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` and the callback are both optional. If a callback is given, it will be invoked when the socket receives a pong frame whose content matches `string`. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.  #### `driver.pong(string = '')`  Sends a pong frame over the socket, queueing it if necessary. `string` is optional. Returns `false` if frames can no longer be sent, or if the driver does not support ping/pong.  You don't need to call this when a ping frame is received; pings are replied to automatically by the driver. This method is for sending unsolicited pongs.  #### `driver.close()`  Initiates the closing handshake if the socket is still open. For drivers with no closing handshake, this will result in the immediate execution of the `on('close')` driver. For drivers with a closing handshake, this sends a closing frame and `emit('close')` will execute when a response is received or a protocol error occurs.  #### `driver.version`  Returns the WebSocket version in use as a string. Will either be `hixie-75`, `hixie-76` or `hybi-$version`.  #### `driver.protocol`  Returns a string containing the selected subprotocol, if any was agreed upon using the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` mechanism. This value becomes available after `emit('open')` has fired.   ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010-2016 James Coglan  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
